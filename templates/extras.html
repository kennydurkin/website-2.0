                <p class="article_text">“Airbnb and home-sharing are here to stay, and it’s a matter of time before we fix this law.”<br>
                – Nick Papas, Director of Public Affairs at Airbnb</p>

                <p class="article_text">What if you needed the government’s permission every time you let your friends crash for the night? Say you received a notice claiming you were operating an “illegal hotel” for not obtaining clearance to let your out-of-town family stay over for the week. Would you argue there’s a line to be drawn? Friends? Friends of friends? Complete strangers?</p>

                <p class="article_text">There’s a war going on right now in New York City – a war involving your home, mine, and every other New Yorker’s in the city. The sharing economy has taken the country by storm, but in no city and in no industry has it been as fiercely disruptive and disputed than home-sharing in NYC, an industry which San Francisco startup Airbnb seems to have made happen overnight. Founded in 2009, the company has astronomically risen as the front-runner not only in its own sect, but in the share economy at large, enabling the average homeowner to make money securely renting out property to guests by leveraging today’s technology. The demographics are easily skewed towards tech-savvy millennials who travel often, attributing for its popularities in cities such as San Francisco and Portland. But when it comes to the biggest and most diverse city in the world with one of its largest hotel conglomerates notoriously averse to change, it’s easy to see that becoming the norm is going to be a grueling task. This is one fight that Airbnb can’t afford to lose.</p>

                <p class="article_text">In recent years, Airbnb has begun to find out as the share economy has forcefully awoken the sleeping giants of industry that had come to be accepted as the status quo. Similar to the equally sizable ridesharing service Uber’s battles with the taxi industry, Airbnb has attracted the ire of the hotel industry, local housing committees, and various politicians and lobbyists within Congress.  At the homeowner level, Airbnb’s throughout the neighborhood has been providing landlords justification for rising rent costs, negatively impacting the community both economically and culturally regardless of their involvement. Citing affordable housing concerns amongst an array of complaints regarding disruption within the community, coalitions like Share Better have risen together to refuse the takeover of their local neighborhoods. Their website presents a less flattering light on Airbnb, stating that “far from being a harmless service where New York City residents can share their homes with guests to the City, Airbnb enables New York City tenants to break the law and potentially violate their leases, exacerbates the affordable housing crisis in our neighborhoods, and poses serious public safety concerns for Airbnb guests, hosts and their neighbors”. Local horror stories have begun to emerge, and both landlords and unaffiliated tenants have joined the fray in order to keep the status quo.</p>

                <p class="article_text">From the industry level, its most popular criticism is the fact that it’s been evading taxes normally paid by orthodox hotel services. Although the case may be made that Airbnb technically owns no real estate, when presented with the prospect of legally sanctioning in cities out like San Francisco and Portland, they were quick to oblige and are currently paying the cities a standard hotel business’s tax cut. Dangling as much as $65 million in annual tax revenue, NYC legislators aren’t taking the bait. They contend that the number is grossly misrepresented when also factoring in the argument that all Airbnb listings should be legal, transitioning the argument to a law abiding standpoint.</p>

                <p class="article_text">According to a report by the New York State Attorney General this past October, almost three-fourths of units posted on Airbnb in NYC have been technically labeled as in violation of the law, a massive figure condemning Airbnb’s practices and compliance enforcement of their hosts.  Legally, the leading legal obstacle to Airbnb traces back to the Multiple Dwellings Law (MDL), passed by New York State 2010. Essentially, the law effectively bans all short term rentals under 30 days unless the homeowner is present and currently living in the same shared area (think having family or friends over). However, back in 2010, Airbnb was only just picking up steam on the West Coast, and it’s generally agreed that Airbnb was not the target here as it was instead intended to put a stopper on illegal hotels, which were essentially entrepreneurial real estate owners providing Airbnb-like service while acting in full awareness of the illegality of their operation. The problem today is that these individuals are now taking full advantage of Airbnb’s platform to execute their operations. According to the report, “The highest-earning operation administered 272 unique Airbnb listings, booked 3,024 reservations, and received $6.8 million in revenue during the Review Period. Each of the top 12 New York City operations on Airbnb during that period earned revenue exceeding $1 million.” With these exploitations, Airbnb has essentially been lumped in with the bad guys. However, the share economy was not around to empower the everyday homeowner back then, resulting in this massive grey area regarding the law today. “When does a person become a business? If you’re lending your apartment all the time to friends but not charging for it, that’s totally legal. So do you become a hotel the moment you rent your apartment for one night for $1?”</p>

                <p class="article_text">Obviously, the majority of that 72 percent are not scheming to run multimillion dollar businesses through Airbnb, but according to lawmakers, they should all be taken down. Airbnb’s first attempt to combat this was to try and repeal the law altogether. During 2014, a massive marketing campaign involving lobbying firms, television and subway ads, and online petitions was undergone by the company, sinking millions of dollars into public relations across the city, but no dice. Lawmakers refuse to change what is considered the strongest defense against illegal hotel operators, so in January this year the company sent an open letter to NYS legislators, taking a more cooperative standpoint: “New Yorkers should be able to responsibly share the home in which they live. The law should be carefully amended to make it possible for regular people to occasionally share only the home in which they live, while not providing loopholes for illegal hotels to operate.” While the ideals remain the same and it can be agreed Airbnb has good intentions, its business model presents a complicated problem from a modern legal standpoint.</p>

                <p class="article_text">So where do we go from here? Recently valued at over $20 billion dollars early this year, Airbnb is just getting started with spending. With millions of users and growth surging, the popularity of the service worldwide isn’t going anywhere, and most comparable cities have already legalized the service, with London being one of the most recent to enact legislation making it easier for users to operate on sharing services. The concerns of New York lawmakers are valid and Airbnb’s shortcomings are no trivial matter, but one thing is certain: the share economy is here to stay. With the right mediation, Airbnb will likely see itself legalized in New York City before the decade is out. The company is going to have to accept the appropriate legislation and restrictions, and even if it may involve violating their business model like implementing a permit system or turning data over to the appropriate committees. Ideally, the city should be rushing to meet them cohesively from a policy standpoint, as the share economy has truly presented some huge opportunities; better to adapt and benefit from an otherwise economically rich surge of activity, than to attempt to stifle it and be left behind in the world market. Both sides have good intentions, but both parties are going to realize the hard lesson that neither is leaving anytime soon. This compromise, if it can be reached, is going to be essential to the sharing economy’s growth.</p>

                <p class="article_text">It is an exciting time for legislation – a chance for new ideas to flourish as the world market evolves both for entrepreneurs and regulators alike. As Airbnb’s case study indicates, the sharing economy isn’t set in stone – not by a long shot – but it’s here to stay. Definitely keep an eye out on the evolution of this dynamic landscape, both in New York and the world at large, and see how both camps rise to meet the challenge.</p>

            <div class="organization_detail a2 animated">
                <p class="article_text">“No one’s fearful, everyone’s greedy, and eventually it will end.” This quote from venture capitalist Bill Gurley accurately sums up the situation that’s developing in the Silicon Valley. Reminiscent of the dot-com boom and bust of the late 1990s, the tech industry seems to be yet again on the brink, if not already in the midst, of an economic bubble. This may come as a surprise to some, but mainstream news outlets have had some telltale signs as cover stories over the past year. On the ground level, disaster couldn’t be farther from reality. The tech industry is very much in the middle of a boom, with new deals in acquisition and recruitment being made rampantly and base salaries for software engineers nearing $100k and rumors of even higher. So on what grounds do we demean one of the greatest growths in the economy since the recession with the term “bubble”?</p>

                <p class="article_text">For starters, there’s no money being made. These very companies spending seed capital and venture funding with no restraints are the ones in the least position to do so, with either no or negligible revenue. Take the example of WhatsApp, the global communications app purchased by Facebook this year for a whopping $19 billion. Even when considering their ~450 million users, it is estimated only 10% pay the $1 annual subscription fee, putting its actual revenue grossly behind the number that gave 55 employees an early retirement. To this day it remains debated as to why the number was so disproportionate, but it serves an excellent testimony to the overvaluation of the modern technology industry. These startups are bought on the foundation of potential-as users are becoming a form of pseudo-currency-with angel investors and venture capitalists hoping to be the first ones on the boat to the next Google or Facebook.</p>

                <p class="article_text">From a strictly numerical point of view, the trend in growth has been eerily similar to the rise of the dot-com startups of the late ’90s. The adverb is present due to the fact that by Q3/Q4 of 2000 they were closing their doors by the dozens as the dot-com bubble finally burst. As Business Insider reports, data from Thomson Reuters indicates that total tech investment is back to where it was at in 2000.</p>

                <p class="article_text">Although the number of deals is not, it is well past its 1999 counterpart and could indicate that simply more money is being pumped into fewer companies, resulting in massive overvaluations. On the other hand, we haven’t seen the alarming rates of tech companies making their initial public offerings as there were fifteen years ago.</p>

                <p class="article_text">Rather, there have been drastically fewer, such that venture capitalists have continued to supply these companies with what would normally have been provided for by the public market, with late stage rounds showing this with a $44.1 million average up 77% from last year. New Republic‘s Noam Scheiber draws an ironic distinction and parallel in that “the good news is that most of the money lost when the bubble bursts will come from private investors, who can afford it. The bad news is that, 15 years after the last tech bubble, we still haven’t proven we can look at a tech startup and judge it by the value it actually has.”</p>

                <p class="article_text">Historically, this frenzy has been geographically centered on the Silicon Valley, but this go-around nonprofits and governments are pushing for more startups. Cities such as New York and Austin are feeding the economical and cultural mindset, both of which have proven to be unsustainable. As Forbes contributor Marianne Hudson writes, many startups from all over are trekking to Silicon Valley and quoting Silicon Valley valuations in their fundraising back at home. Couple that with increasing media coverage, data availability, internet communication and discussion about early stage investment, it’s highly likely that the bubble will trickle into other regions.</p>

                <p class="article_text">This is all not to say that simply because there is a similar rise there will be an equally painful fall. If the industry is to learn from their mistakes, the historical trends need to be brought to attention and analyzed. The numbers are soaring. What is your business doing differently than those of 15 years prior? How can you take advantage of this boom without setting yourself up for disaster in what could be less than a year? Advocates of the current boom would argue that those investing now are seasoned vets of the dot-com bust, knowing what works and what doesn’t, with more savviness and realistic visions than the overestimation of the onset of the internet. Yet, the evaluations of new industries such as mobile, cloud, and software as a service, are being justified, and millions of dollars are being poured into them, without adhering to the revenue axis in the startup lifestyle.</p>

                <p class="article_text">These start-ups may just survive their “valleys of death” and obtain the profit and growth needed in order to turn into sustainable businesses. The lessons may indeed have been learned from the past and perhaps the spending and acquisitions will become justifiable. However, it requires a constant state of mind from both those running and those pouring money into these new companies.</p>

                <p class="article_text">Fortunately, the consensus of the bubble being a threat and awareness raised puts both investors and founders on their heels. With the header quote of the article coming from a well renowned VC, another example comes from the vocal a16z founder Marc Andreessen, who states “A lot of these companies are only spending money. They’re not making money. They’re just technology projects. They got some funding so now instead of eating pizza they’re eating catered lunches, thinking that means it’s a real company.” From the business side, Coupa CEO Rob Bernshteyn, in a guest post for Forbes, offers a follow-up and is an example of staying focused throughout the chaos: “There’s nothing wrong with spending some money on that; it’s part of the company’s maturing process and you should be celebrating your successes—to a point. Better office furniture, yes. Aeron chairs for everyone, no. Bringing in lunch a few days a month, yes. Having it catered by a five-star restaurant… not so much.” Regardless of whether the bubble pops or not, a gut-check is in order to make sure that come what may, the fundamentals of any particular company are sound.</p>

                <p class="article_text">Right now, while we speculate and write articles about the direction of the tech industry, its fate is being decided by the actions and interactions of investors and co-founders alike. If a company is to shed the playful moniker of startup and reveal itself to be a business, sustainability questions need to be answered, the cash burn rate dealt with, and an ROI feasible within the near future. However, by the data shown and experience painfully gained, the stakes seem to be at a more moderate level this time around. The shadow of the bubble looms over the Silicon Valley, but if the original lessons are learned and advice heeded its bursting won’t mean another technological abyss, just a much needed purging: a final separation of the startups from the businesses.</p>

            <div class="organization_detail a3 animated">
                <p class="article_text">In the past couple of years, the collegiate tech community has revitalized itself further than ever before.  As technological advancements continue to increase exponentially, so too are the social and practical opportunities with which students can familiarize themselves with.  Hackathons have become such a tool.  From the rewards and projects teams create to the overall networking and learning experience of it all, they are are serving as a vital spark of inspiration needed in today's STEM circles. There is a movement out there taking university tech communities by storm, and we're living right in the middle of its take-off.  Here's why Fordham should be taking part.</p>

                <p class="article_text">Hackathons are probably the best extracurriculars currently out there for student entrepreneurs, designers, programmers, engineers, and builders in general.  By Wikipedia's definition, it's a portmanteau of the word "hack" and "marathon", events in which programmers meet to do collaborative computer programming.  One could argue this could be equated with a simple group project at school, but that is where the difference lies: when standing in the middle of one, you can almost feel the vibrancy and life propagating through the air around you.  Everyone is motivated and determined to learn something new and to simply make.  While our universities sometimes struggle to support every student's creativity and development, students nationwide are rallying in an attempt to pick up the pieces - and it's working wonders.</p>

                <p class="article_text">You may be thinking that the term "hack" is a reason to raise eyebrows, and it is true that it carries its negative connotations.  However, it is an overloaded term, meaning there are several other, more deserving connotations, with the simplest meaning "create". Inventing and nurturing an idea into reality is the core of this movement, not breaking into systems and accessing data.  Hackathons focus on the lighter, more positive side to development: one of the reason's why it has become such a large phenomenon in so short a time period.  People are presented with the opportunity to learn a new skill, test a new idea, and to try something out without taking it too seriously.</p>

                <p class="article_text">The basic formula for an average hackathon usually boils down to the following: (idea + technology - sleep) ÷ a team = your hack.  A typical "hack" can take the form of a number of projects, such as a websites, a mobile app, wearable technology, and robots, to name a few.  Notable hacks have actually gone on to become successful startups such as "GroupMe", the popular messaging app, which was acquired by Skype for $85 million a year after its inception. Or you could take features that have become popular in other ways, such as the Facebook Like button.  Twitter itself was conceived in a hackathon!  The best part is that little to none of the team or their project exists prior to the event aside from an idea.  Aside from the central motif of not beginning your work until the event, there are usually no rules, no template, and no set structure to how teams go about this. Students gather to a venue, network and brainstorm with completely new people, and within hours, are set to making their vision happen. Everyone brings something different to the table, whether it be a great mind for design, impeccable coding prowess, or a strong engineering foundation.  All the elements present in an actual technology company are right there in that moment. Glancing at all the scratchwork with which their game plans have been set and tasks split up accordingly, one gets the impression that they are walking through a room where dozens of miniature start-ups have been thrust into existence, working furiously for a working demo to display by the competition's end.  And even when the event ends, it doesn't necessarily mean that the project does.</p>

                <p class="article_text">This "rapid prototyping" all gets done over the course of one weekend, and is by no means the only thing that increases exponentially.  One particular phrase that comes to mind is "learning on steroids".  Aside from your peers who are always there to help and collaborate with, sponsors and recruiters hold a significant presence at these events.  They can range from high-powered startups such as Dropbox and Nest to tech giants like Apple and Facebook.  As these dynamic companies are usually looking to hire new developers, the argument could be made that they're becoming the new replacement for career fairs.  Recruiters are looking for students who have the know-how and motivation to actually build something, and they're quite right to attend hackathons in search of those new employees.  But even better, they're also there to help.  By mentoring students who may be new to programming, unfamiliar with a certain interface, or are simply stumped by a roadblock and need help debugging, a relationship is fostered and the work is being experienced side by side between oneself and a mentor, a much more tangible alternative to an interview in this particular field. All the tools one might hope for and would be harder to access at home or on campus, are readily available.</p>

                <p class="article_text">So, to those who may respond with a shrug and the response, "I don't know how to code": Just dive in.  There is no better place to immerse yourself and use as a starting point than here, allowing you to, no matter how slight, begin or improve upon your technical skill set.  To quote from Dave Fontenot, founder of one of the country's largest hackathons, "Technology is not an industry; it's a tool that is disrupting every industry.  People aren't technical or non-technical.  Technology is simply a competitive advantage that anyone can add to their skill set.  It's a force multiplier for everything you do.  It allows you to delimit yourself by replacing rudimentary, repetitive tasks and computation with programs a computer can run in an instant.  If you don't use it, you are making a decision to pass on the greatest competitive advantage that has ever existed."  Yes, you will learn how to code.  But more importantly, you'll see it as a means to an end, and the passion that building that end entails will be what ends up making the decision worthwhile.</p>

                <p class="article_text">This image of the average programmer, developer, and designer is mindblowingly different from the archetypes of decades past, and is going to continue to grow and evolve. The need for developers in the job market today only further confirms this growth. Where the education system can't keep up, finally, the hackathon has provided a vehicle in which the transformation of the computer scientist and computer science education can take place.  They are taking the main stage, and will only continue to attract the spotlight. By participating in this culture now while it's still on the rise, Fordham will not only be putting its students miles ahead of the competition when they go out into the field, but will be laying the groundwork with which future generations can look to as something they want to be a part of, a culture where the excitement of seeing what they can do with the skills they have learned (or are about to learn) is second nature to everyone involved.  That's the dream, but for now, awareness and curiosity are the first steps that have to be taken by each individual.  Thus, I offer this appeal to you: if you consider yourself a creator by any standard, or this culture simply sounds neat and intriguing, take the time to get your feet wet, see what all the hype is about, and hopefully it can be the spark for you, too.</p>

                <p class="article_text">The bottom line: more and more people are using this platform and technology to turn their ideas into a reality.  Fordham deserves to take its place on that platform.</p>
